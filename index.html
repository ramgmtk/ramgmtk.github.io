                    <p>
                        My name is Rammohan Ramanathan. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz 
                        with a bachelors in Computer Science: Game design. While programming games is fun, I also enjoy 
                        programming in a general software engineering sense. Optimizing code for use with multiple cores in a processor  
                        and utilizing algorithms to improve runtime of programming tasks are some non-game focused areas I enjoy 
                        working in.
                        <br><br>
                        There is a gap in my education after graduating from High School. Between 2013 and 2017 I took time off from college 
                        to reconsider my degree choice and figure out what my plans for the future were. I returned to college in 2017 and took up 
                        pursuing a degree in computer science. My prior experience with mathematics and programming was sour as I was poor in those subjects. 
                        However after the break I took I was able to approach these classes with a more focused mind and a different way of thinking. 
                        I believe the break I took helped me to shift my perspective on education and as a result I performed better than I ever 
                        have in school, earning highest honors on my bachelors degree.

                            This github repository is being used to practice the implementation of MCTS.
                            I prototyped an android app that plays tic tac toe against the user. 
                            the first passs of the code was done in c++. The program is a tac tac toe bot which uses 
                            Monte Carlo to inform the bots decisions each turn. The bot prioritizes wins and ignores 
                            defense currently as a result of its current rollout strategy and number of noned the bot expands on.
                            The java version of the code is almost an exact copy of the c++ prototype, with some minor class changes to better suit java syntax.
                            The application was built in android app studio using the java version of the project as a source. The app studio classes interface with the
                            underlying java code to update the state of the board in the application.

                            This github repository links to a small practice project I did to review working with graphs.
                            I wanted to setup a program that could find the shortest path through multiple nodes
                            from a given starting point. The inspiration for this project stemmed from watching a delivery driver drive their
                            route to deliver parcels. I figure their naviagtion tool gives them the fastest path through multiple destinations
                            so they can finish their job quickly. I wanted to try and create something similar. The program 
                            makes use of dijkstra's shortest path and various supporting data structures like a min heap in order 
                            to accomplish this.

                            During my final year at UCSC I worked in a team of 11 on a game called "Gods Of Corruption".
                            I was one of the three programmers who helped develope the game.
                            The game was made using the Unity Engine, and the Yarn Spinner dialogue tool.
                            It is an action game centered around the boss rush genre. I worked on programming some of the bosses, 
                            the ui, and overall bug fixing. The footage on in the preview video uses a slightly older build of our game.

                            My group project for my Game AI class was based around procedurally generating a dungeon that
                            was solveable given whatever mechanics a designer adds to the dungeon. We used Unity to create a
                            simplified dungeon generation tool which utilized AI programming techniques such as constraint satisfaction,
                            goal oriented action planning, and drama management to verify a dungeons completion as well as monitor
                            the dungeons state dynamically. The avatar moving through the dungeon finds the most effective path to 
                            get the key to exit the dungeon, and navigate towards the exit room. Using some basic heuristics we 
                            determine if the player would survive the room encounter and spawn more enemies or health in the next room

                            For my generative design class I worked with my classmates to create an environment 
                            that could generate planets procedurally while having them orbit. 
                            The base concept was adapted from a youtube tutorial by Sebastian Lague. 
                            The planets generated use multiple layers of simplex noise to create complex 
                            and varied surface level features. I modified the planet generation by having 
                            the work be computed dynamically, as well as adding the ability to apply 
                            seeds for generation. The additional features 
                            such as adding rings around the planet, and how the planets were shaded were done by 
                            my teammates.
