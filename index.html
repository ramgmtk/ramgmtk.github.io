            <a href="https://redhawkstudios.itch.io/gods-of-corruption" target="_blank">UCSC Senior Capstone Game</a><br>
            <br>
            During my final year at UCSC I worked in a team of 10 on a game called "Gods Of Corruption".<br>
            I was one of the three programmers who helped develope the game.<br>
            The game was made using the Unity Engine, and the Yarn Spinner dialogue tool.<br>
            It is an action game centered around the boss rush genre.<br>
