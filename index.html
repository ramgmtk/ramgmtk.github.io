                        My name is Rammohan Ramanathan. I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz 
                        with a bachelors in Computer Science: Game design. While programming games is fun, I also enjoy 
                        programming in a general software engineering sense. Optimizing code for use with multiple cores in a processor  
                        and utilizing algorithms to improve runtime of programming tasks are some non-game focused areas I enjoy 
                        working in.

                        There is a gap in my education after graduating from High School. Between 2013 and 2017 I took a break from college 
                        as I was not performing well and was not happy with my current degree choice. I returned to college in 2017 and took up 
                        pursuing a degree in computer science. My prior experience with mathematics and programming was sour as I was poor in those subjects. 
                        However after the break I took I was able to approach these classes with a more focused mind and a different way of thinking. 
                        I believe the break I took helped me to shift my perspective on education and as a result I performed better than I ever 
                        have in school, earning highest honors on my bachelors degree.

                    <div class="description" style="float: left; padding-right: 100px;">
                        My group project for my Game AI class was based around procedurally generating a dungeon that
                        was solveable given whatever mechanics a designer adds to the dungeon. We used Unity to create a
                        simplified dungeon generation tool which utilized AI programming techniques such as constraint satisfaction,
                        goal oriented action planning, and drama management to verify a dungeons completion as well as monitor
                        the dungeons state dynamically. The avatar moving through the dungeon finds the most effective path to 
                        get the key to exit the dungeon, and navigate towards the exit room. Using some basic heuristics we 
                        determine if the player would survive the room encounter and spawn more enemies or health in the next room 
                        accordingly.

                        During my final year at UCSC I worked in a team of 11 on a game called "Gods Of Corruption".
                        I was one of the three programmers who helped develope the game.
                        The game was made using the Unity Engine, and the Yarn Spinner dialogue tool.
                        It is an action game centered around the boss rush genre. I worked on programming some of the bosses, 
                        the ui, and overall bug fixing. The footage on in the preview video uses a slightly older build of our game.

                    <h2><u>Procedural Planet Generation</u></h2>
                    <div class="description" style="float: left; padding-right: 100px;">
                        For my generative design class I worked with my classmates to create an environment 
                        that could generate planets procedurally while having them orbit. 
                        The base concept was adapted from a youtube tutorial by Sebastian Lague. 
                        The planets generated use multiple layers of simplex noise to create complex 
                        and varied surface level features. I modified the planet generation by having 
                        the work be computed dynamically, as well as adding the ability to apply 
                        seeds for generation. The additional features 
                        such as adding rings around the planet, and how the planets were shaded were done by 
                        my teammates.
